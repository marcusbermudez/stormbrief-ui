# StormBrief Application Blueprint

## Overview

StormBrief is a web application that provides a free, localized summary of recent storm activity, including severe storms, hail, and wind events. It presents this data in a clean, easy-to-read report format.

## Project Outline & Features

### V1 (Initial Implementation)

*   **Structure:** Single-page application using `index.html`.
*   **Styling:** Modern CSS in `style.css` featuring:
    *   **Color Palette:** A vibrant and energetic look using a range of blues, grays, and accent colors for warnings.
    *   **Typography:** Expressive fonts (e.g., from Google Fonts) to create a clear visual hierarchy (headings, body text, data points).
    *   **Layout:** A responsive, mobile-first design using Flexbox and CSS Grid. The main content will be centered in a card-like container on larger screens.
    *   **Visual Effects:** Subtle noise texture on the background and multi-layered drop shadows on cards to create depth and a premium feel.
*   **Content:**
    *   Location and search context section.
    *   Storm summary section with key statistics.
    *   Detailed list of recent storm events.
    *   Data sources and limitations section.
    *   An upgrade call-to-action button.
*   **Data:** The initial version will use static, placeholder data to illustrate the application's functionality.

## Current Plan: Initial Design and Content Enhancement

The user is setting up their preview. I will proactively improve the base application from a skeleton to a visually appealing and functional demonstration.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create `blueprint.md`:** Establish the project's blueprint and document this plan.
2.  **Enhance `index.html`:** Add semantic HTML structure, link to Google Fonts, and add CSS classes for styling. Replace placeholder text like `[date]` with realistic sample data.
3.  **Create `style.css`:** Implement the V1 design as outlined above, including colors, fonts, layout, and visual effects.
4.  **Update `main.js`:** Keep it minimal for now, possibly adding it to the HTML for future use.
